This is a Real time Data Tracker using Elastic Search for dynamically collecting Realtime datasets from business
models like Garmin health data, Finn hub stocks data and integrating it through python and pushing it
live into Kibana graphs

Develop a Model to gather, analyze and visualize health records , physical activities and mental wellnesses across global population. As the world is spiking towards binge eating and unhealthy lifestyle habits, an analysis of globalized health tracker is highly necessary to highlight the world , the need of active and healthy lifestyle.

Current health tracking applications in market show health status for oneself using data from one's own IOT watches. We have decided to use leading Garmin as our product store which produces Garmin watches, from which we can extract real
time data of millions of users as it is widely used among fitness freaks and active human beings to track their daily wellness. This would definitely fetch huge data which is a very good target for DBMS analysis.

We are developing  a statistics visualization of global healthy activities tracker .We are planning to use Elastic search to research the Garmin data and showcase the statistics in Kibana Dashboard. We are working with Garmin team, for  the access to Garmin open API data to fetch their health tracker stores consisting data on Fitness, Training, Wellness and all other health related parameters like heartrate, sleep, steps, stress level, menstrual cycle etc.
